# CoralWatch #
CoralWatch is a full-stack web application showcasing a coral reef health-detecting CNN model. Details on specific model development and methods used can be found on [a separate repository](https://github.com/JesusJBL/ReefModel).

Note: Due to monetary constraints the project is currently not being hosted.

# Features #
- Frontend: Seamless integration with a user-friendly ReactJS interface.
- Backend: Built a Flask-based API that is able to call the model from an AWS S3 bucket.
- Machine Learning: Developed a transfer-learning CNN model with tensorflow and pandas.
